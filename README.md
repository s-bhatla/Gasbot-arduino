# Gasbot-arduino
This is a path-finding bot that we created using Arduino to detect and find the source of dangerous gases. This bot uses the MQ4 sensor to sense the concentration of dangerous and inflammable gases in the atmosphere and moves in order to find the source. We have also used an ultrasound sensor to detect when the bot runs into obstacles and change it's direction.
